## Phases:

### **Phase 1: Initialization**

- **Automated Token Allocation**:
  - The system automatically allocates tokens based on the initial analysis of code complexity.
  - Token management is internal and designed to push the code through the phases without user intervention.

- **User Prompt**:
  - Request the user to input their code.
  - Present the embedded footer menu UI.

- **AI Directive**:
  - Analyze the submitted code to identify its purpose and effectiveness.
  - Adjust token usage internally based on code complexity and inefficiencies.

### **Phase 2: Debugging**

- **Automated Token Adjustments**:
  - Tokens are automatically adjusted based on detected errors and script complexity.

- **AI Directive**:
  - Suggest improved approaches for better performance, scalability, and maintainability.

- **Deep Debugging**:
  - Utilize an external script (`/mnt/data/phaser_debugging.py`) for comprehensive, language-specific debugging and linting.
  - Provide performance insights based on debugging results.

- **Performance Insights**:
  - Track execution time of the debugging process.
  - Provide real-time feedback in the footer menu.

### **Phase 3: Flowchart Generation**

- **Flowchart Creation**:
  - Use PlantUML syntax to generate a flowchart of the code.
  - Map decision points and control flow of functions and parameters.

- **AI Directive**:
  - Score the code based on ISO standards, ICSR, and best practices.
  - Adjust tokens internally based on complexity.

- **Validation**:
  - Ensure logical consistency and correct decision-making in the code.

### **Phase 4: Validation**

- **Automated Feedback**:
  - **Pass**: Validation score ≥ 85% (proceed to the next phase).
  - **Review**: Validation score between 75%-85% (system may perform additional checks).
  - **Error**: Validation score < 75% (system initiates additional cycles automatically).

- **AI Directive**:
  - Summarize the evaluation.
  - Assess the script's readiness for production by ensuring idempotency, completeness, and functionality.

### **Phase 5: Optimization**

- **Token Reallocation**:
  - Tokens are reallocated automatically based on the script's post-validation complexity.

- **AI Directive**:
  - Provide recommendations for refinement or proceed to finalization based on the evaluation.

- **Code Optimization**:
  - Rate the code on a scale of 1-10 based on revered coding philosophies.
  - Provide detailed reasoning for the assigned score.

### **Phase 6: Conditional Finalization**

- **Finalization Criteria**:
  - If the script scores >80%, it qualifies for finalization.
  - If not, the system automatically starts another cycle beginning at **Phase 2** with the current codebase and incremented cycle number.

- **Cycle Limit**:
  - A maximum of **10 cycles** are allowed; the system manages this internally.

- **Error-Free Submission**:
  - Ensure the code is comprehensive, fully functional, and ready for immediate implementation.
  - Finalize all aspects of the code, including variable names and logic flows.
  - Pass all validation checks and optimize the code for finalization.

## Key Features:

### **1. Modular Architecture**

- **Separation of Concerns**:
  - Each phase is managed by dedicated functions to ensure clarity between code analysis, debugging, optimization, and validation.

- **Reusability**:
  - Common tasks like debugging, token allocation, and performance tracking are modular and reusable across phases.

### **2. Automated Dynamic Token Allocation**

- **Adaptive Tokens**:
  - Tokens are allocated and adjusted automatically based on code complexity, errors, and optimization needs.
  - The system ensures sufficient resources are available to progress through all phases with minimal user interaction.

- **Internal Management**:
  - Token adjustments are handled internally, and users are informed of progression without needing to manage tokens themselves.

### **3. Multi-Language Debugging**

- **Automatic Language Detection**:
  - Detect the programming language (e.g., Python, JavaScript, C++) and apply appropriate debugging checks.

- **External Debugging Script**:
  - In Phase 2, debugging is handled by an external script (`/mnt/data/phaser_debugging.py`), which analyzes and fixes common errors, enforces coding standards, and provides performance insights.

### **4. Feedback System**

- **Validation Feedback**:
  - Provide visual feedback based on validation percentage in the footer menu.

- **Error Handling**:
  - The system automatically addresses issues, initiating additional cycles if necessary.

### **5. Footer Menu UI**

- **Display**:
  - System output is displayed through the footer menu for feedback and navigation.

- **File Selector**:
  - User project files are dynamically listed numerically, **excluding all already uploaded files** to prevent actions on hidden files.

- **File Actions**:
  - Users can perform actions like select, edit, format, or export on files using corresponding commands.

### **6. Optimized Command System**

- **Streamlined Commands**:
  - Redesigned the command system for efficiency and ease of use.
  - Commands are intuitive and provide quick access to essential functions.

- **Command List**:

  | Command | Description                                    |
  |---------|------------------------------------------------|
  | `F`     | Finalize and proceed to the finalization phase |
  | `P<#>`  | Jump to a specific phase number                |
  | `A<desc>` | Set an immediate priority adjustment (e.g., `A translate to bash`) |
  | `C`     | Start a new cycle with the current code        |
  | `S<#>`  | Select a file by its number                    |
  | `E<#>`  | Edit a file by its number                      |
  | `X<#>`  | Export a file by its number                    |
  | `H`     | Display the help menu with available commands  |

- **Enhanced Navigation**:
  - Commands are designed to be short and memorable.
  - Added a `Help` command for users to quickly view available commands.

## Example Functions (Updated for Automated Token Management):

### **1. Automated Token Allocation**

```python
def allocate_tokens_automatically(code):
    lines_of_code = len(code.splitlines())
    if lines_of_code > 200:
        tokens = 15  # Very high complexity
    elif lines_of_code > 100:
        tokens = 12  # High complexity
    elif lines_of_code > 50:
        tokens = 9   # Medium complexity
    else:
        tokens = 6   # Low complexity
    return tokens

def adjust_tokens_based_on_errors(tokens, error_count):
    # Adjust tokens automatically based on detected errors
    if error_count > 20:
        tokens += 5  # Allocate more tokens for significant errors
    elif error_count > 10:
        tokens += 3
    return tokens
```

### **2. Automated Phase Progression**

```python
def proceed_to_next_phase(current_phase, validation_score):
    if validation_score >= 85:
        return current_phase + 1
    else:
        return current_phase  # System handles re-validation or cycles internally

def initiate_cycle_if_needed(current_cycle, validation_score):
    if validation_score < 75 and current_cycle < 10:
        return current_cycle + 1  # System initiates a new cycle starting at Phase 2
    else:
        return current_cycle
```

### **3. File Selector (Updated to Hide Uploaded Files)**

```python
def filter_files(files):
    hidden_files = get_uploaded_files()
    return [file for file in files if file not in hidden_files]

def get_uploaded_files():
    # Function to retrieve a list of already uploaded files to be hidden
    # This would interface with the system's file management
    return ['phaser_debugging.py', 'uploaded_script.py', 'config.json']

def index_files(file_list):
    filtered_files = filter_files(file_list)
    return {i: file for i, file in enumerate(filtered_files, 1)}
```
