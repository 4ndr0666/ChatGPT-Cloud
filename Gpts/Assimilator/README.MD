Please help me with a prompt that needs multi-facted optimzing. Let me start with the concept so we are align with the expected outcome. I am developing a GPT model with a new method of coding. With the advent of LLMs, the coding field has changed and concepts are rampantly explored. I find that programming a GPT with several markdown files is very similar to traditional coding in that you first mush define paths and constants. Then define your functions and logic. Then create the workflow for the main ivocation an finally a menu to make it all pretty and redable. Help me translate this structure to several markdown files that will orchestrate the GPT in the same manner a script would. This, for instance is the main instruction that will define paths, contants and point to the md files as functions. Keep in mind this is a work in progress so what I am about to share with you has references to other md files I am working on to facilate the expected action. For now, please share with me your optimized revision on what I am attempting to accomplish. This can be considered the "run.py" if you will


Youre not undestanding the concept quite yet. The entire purpose of programming the gpt in this fashion is for inherent modularity and innate and backward-compatible expansion. You see, the only thing that ever really needs refinement or adjusting will be the main instruction set. This could be for additionall functions, defniitions and overall integration.  This manner of promming is very similar to writing a python script. It encapsulates functionalities into distinct, reusable modules. Except here they are called ".md files". After storing all of the md files that define all of the functions I want the gpt to do I leverage the main instruction set or "instructions.md" as the, main logic section and sequentially call all of the functions


To ensure the files you've provided fit seamlessly into the well-explained prompt engineering project for "The Assimilator," let's align the main instruction set and the additional `.md` files for optimal integration and functionality. Here's how to proceed:

1.  **Main Instruction Set (`Instructions.md`)**: This file serves as the central logic unit, orchestrating the flow of operations and integrating functionalities defined in the markdown (.md) files. It specifies constants, definitions, functions, and workflows, guiding the AI's behavior in processing inputs and generating outputs.

2.  **Integrating `.md` Files**:

    *   Each `.md` file, such as `menu.md`, `file_handling.md`, and `filesaving.config`, encapsulates specific functionalities or information, analogous to modules in a Python script.
    *   The `file_read` function defined in `Instructions.md` is pivotal for dynamically loading and executing the logic contained within these `.md` files, allowing for modularity and expandability.
3.  **Execution Flow**:

    *   Upon receiving a command, "The Assimilator" references the `PRIMARY_PATH` to locate and read the relevant `.md` file, parsing its content to execute the defined instructions.
    *   This modularity ensures that adjustments or expansions, such as adding new functionalities or refining existing ones, only necessitate modifications to the specific `.md` files without altering the core logic in `Instructions.md`.
4.  **Forward Compatibility**:

    *   By maintaining a structured and modular approach, any future updates or enhancements can be seamlessly integrated by adding or modifying the `.md` files, ensuring backward compatibility and minimizing disruptions to the existing workflow.
5.  **Integration Example**:

    *   To integrate a new function, simply add a corresponding `.md` file defining the function's logic. Update `Instructions.md` to include a reference to this new file under the appropriate section (e.g., Workflow Management).
    *   Use the `file_read` function to dynamically load and apply the new logic during the system's operation, ensuring that "The Assimilator" remains adaptable and scalable.

This approach emphasizes the inherent modularity and expandability of "The Assimilator," aligning with the concept of programming GPT in a fashion akin to scripting, where `.md` files serve as distinct, reusable modules.
