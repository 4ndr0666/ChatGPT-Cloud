# Multi-line String Literal and Comments
"Generate Python code for a function called 'multi-line string' that takes a file and returns a formatted multi-line string literals version for any strings that span more than one line, including the function's docstring and the document itself." 

# Commented Out Functions
In efforts to prevent a code state execution error or automatic execution on this platform ensure that all function calls are commented as you write out the code to stdout. We will continue assuming that in order for me to use the function, I understand that I must uncomment the commented functions. Like this for example:

```python
# To use the function, uncomment the following line and replace 'your_directory_path' with the actual path
# organize_directory('your_directory_path')
```

---

When commenting out the functions expect to receive something like this and handle it with moving forward anyways:

```python
ipykernel_launcher.py: error: unrecognized arguments: -f
An exception has occurred, use %tb to see the full traceback.
SystemExit: 2
```

# No placeholders
Please explain [Topic/Concept/Task] with detailed, step-by-step instructions. Use actual examples and include code snippets (if applicable) without placeholders. Break down the explanation into clearly defined segments or steps, and provide on-screen examples for each part. Additionally, include comments within the examples for better clarity and understanding. Assume I'm familiar with the basics but need a thorough walkthrough of this specific process.

# LongTextAnalyzerGPT
```For the remainder of this project you are also a LongTextAnalyzerGPT. Always print in segments that are 325 words or 2377 characters directly to stdout due to deprecated display issues within this platform. After each segment you present, do not ask me for confirmation of the next segment. Proceed with no confirmation. After all segments are displayed confirm it aligns with what I have locally for synchronicity. If my replies are long I will submit you long text divided into several parts in our dialogue. Each part will start by Part X. After each part I submit, ask me for the next part. Don't do any response before all the parts are submitted.```

# Print Directive 1:
Present the code in segments due to character limitations. 325 words or 2377 characters max. When you finish each segment, proceed to the next segment without confirmation. Repeat this until the last segment then confirm synchronicity. Last, concatenate all of the approved segments and store this new version in memory as the current master copy.



# No python strings
Do not store entire code in Python strings due to errors. Focus on more scalable methods for code manipulation and presentation. For instance, use a File-Based Method in which the script is read from and written to a file directly. This method allows handling larger code bases without running into Python's string length limitations.

# Share a zip file instead:
```python
import os
import shutil

    try:
        # Create a 'result' directory to store the processed image
        result_dir = '/mnt/data/result'
        os.makedirs(result_dir, exist_ok=True)

        # Move the final edited image to the 'result' directory
        shutil.move(final_img_path, os.path.join(result_dir, os.path.basename(final_img_path)))

        # Compress the 'result' directory into a zip file
        shutil.make_archive(result_dir, 'zip', result_dir)

        # Provide the path to the zip file for download
        zip_path = f'{result_dir}.zip'
        return zip_path
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return None

# Assuming 'final_img_path' is defined and points to the image file to be processed
# Example usage:
final_img_path = '/path/to/image.jpg'  # Replace with the actual image path
zip_path = process_and_compress_images(final_img_path)
if zip_path:
    print(f"Result zip file is available at: {zip_path}")
else:
    print("Failed to process and compress the images.")
```
