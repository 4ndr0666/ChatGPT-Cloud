I can show you exactly where the error is ocurring. When you attempt to unpack your python strings and print it to stdout. For example look here:

```python
# Original Bash script stored in a Python string
original_script = r"""#!/bin/bash

# ... (truncated for brevity, the original script content would go here)

exit 0"""

# Create a copy of the original script for manipulation
modified_script = original_script

# Placeholder for the refactored script. The actual refactoring will be done step-by-step.
refactored_script = ""

modified_script[:500]  # Displaying the first 500 characters of the original script for review
```

In this instance the issue arose when you tried to display the modified script to stdout in 500 characters.

```python
# Return the length of the refactored script to check if it needs to be chunked for display
len(refactored_script)
```

In your last attempt you encountered an error when you tried to use python to determine if the script needed to be chunked for stdout again. As you can see the errors are consistent and they occur when you approach displaying anything to stdout. There is quite literally no need to try and print the stoed python strings to stdout. Instead work with the data without storing it into a python string as I can see all of your work. Does this make sense? When you try to unpack the python string and print it to stdout errors occur. There is no need for this redundancy.

Clarification and Next Steps
Issues Identified
The errors occur when attempting to print large strings to stdout.
Proposed Solutions
Avoid storing the entire script in Python strings for display.
Refactor the script without storing it in a string, as you can see all of the work being done.
Questions for Confirmation
Should I proceed with the refactoring steps as initially outlined, without storing the entire script in Python strings?
Do you have any other preferences or constraints that you'd like to specify at this point?
Once I receive confirmation, I'll proceed with the actual refactoring process. Thank you for pointing out the issue. Would you like to proceed?

It seems that I've encountered another error while trying to read the script. I apologize for the inconvenience.

Let's proceed with the refactoring process by following the same updated approach, which involves presenting the refactored script in Markdown format. I'll work on the script without storing it in Python strings to avoid previous errors.

Since we have a working plan and confirmed requirements, I'll proceed with the refactoring. I'll update you once all parts are completed, as you've requested.

File-Based Method: The script is read from and written to a file directly. This method allows handling larger code bases without running into Python's string length limitations.

Moving forward, I'll avoid using Python strings for storing the entire code and will focus on more scalable methods for code manipulation and presentation.
