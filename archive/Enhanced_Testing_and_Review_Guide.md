# Step-by-Step Guide for Enhanced Testing and Review Strategy

This guide provides a universal approach to script testing and review, tailored to enhance your existing workflow.

---

## Step 1: Version Control with Git

1. **Initialize Git Repository**: Navigate to your project directory and run:
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

2. **Initial Commit**: Add the initial version of your script and commit:
    ```bash
    git add <Initial_Script.sh>
    git commit -m "Initial version"
    ```

---

## Step 2: Save Draft

1. **Save the Draft Script**: Save the drafted script (`Draft_Script.sh`) into your project directory.

2. **Commit Draft**: Add the draft script to Git and commit:
    ```bash
    git add <Draft_Script.sh>
    git commit -m "Draft version"
    ```

---

## Step 3: Diffuse Comparison

1. **Compare Scripts**: Use Diffuse or a similar tool to compare `<Initial_Script.sh>` and `<Draft_Script.sh>`.

2. **Fix Errors**: Manually fix any errors or discrepancies between the two versions.

---

## Step 4: Code Linting

1. **Run Linter**: Use a shell script linter like `shellcheck` to lint the script:
    ```bash
    shellcheck <Draft_Script.sh>
    ```

2. **Fix Warnings/Errors**: Address any warnings or errors pointed out by the linter.

---

## Step 5: Sublime Text Review

1. **Open in Sublime Text**: Open `<Draft_Script.sh>` in Sublime Text or another text editor of your choice for further review.

2. **Refine Script**: Make any necessary refinements to the script.

---

## Step 6: Test Environment

1. **Create a Test Environment**: Use a virtual machine or container for testing.

2. **Run the Script**: Execute `<Draft_Script.sh>` in the test environment and observe the results.

---

## Step 7: Functional Testing

1. **Test Functions Individually**: Run each modular function in the script to validate its operation.

2. **Record Observations**: Make notes of any anomalies or issues during the testing.

---

## Step 8: Logging

1. **Add Logging**: Incorporate logging statements in the script to capture all actions and errors.

2. **Review Logs**: After running the script, review the logs for any errors or warnings.

---

## Step 9: Final Execution

1. **Execute on Main System**: If all tests are passed, proceed to run the script on your main system.

2. **Commit Final Version**: Commit the final, tested version of the script to Git:
    ```bash
    git add <Final_Script.sh>
    git commit -m "Final, tested version"
    ```

This guide can be adapted for any script and provides a thorough approach to testing and reviewing shell scripts.
